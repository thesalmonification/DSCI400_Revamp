# Project Description
This project seeks to obtain higher classification accuracy for a broad range of EEG emotional responses through the use of transfer learning. Transfer learning is a machine learning process by which knowledge gained in training a model for one problem is used when training a model for a similar second problem. For our project specifically, we intend to split our data into positive and negative emotions for initial training and testing before training our models to classify specific emotion based on our findings during this project. This project will seek to pull from many previous examples in order to optimize our feature extraction and overall collection of relevant features. In this project, we will analyze the relationship between EEG waveforms and mental state in order to map EEG activity to specific emotional responses. 


# Installation Procedure
* All code is designed to be run through Google Colab, which standardizes packages across all users. If officially authorized to reproduce the code of this repo, you have already been given access to a Google Shared Drive which allows you to run our code with the accompanying dataset.
* Also included is a `requirements.txt` file, but it is essentially irrelevant, as all code is designed to be run through Google Colab

# Code Reproducibility
* Only authorized individuals can fully reproduce this code because our dataset is under a confidentiality agreement. All authorized individuals already have access to a Google Shared drive from which to reproduce this code.

* To replicate our Data Science pipeline, please enter the "Data_Wrangling" folder
and follow the instructions in the [README.md](https://github.com/thesalmonification/DSCI400_Revamp/tree/master/Data_Wrangling/README.md) file.


# Data Confidentiality
Our dataset is protected under academic agreement, meaning none of the data may be publicly posted to this repository. Only authorized members for the DSCI 400 class have been given access to the data to reproduce this code.
