# DSCI400_Revamp
A revamped repository, allowing for direct communication with Google Collab.
Created on March 2, 2020 for the DSCI 400 Health Team: Analyzing EEG Emotions Through Transfer Learning

To replicate our Data Science pipeline, please enter the "Data_Wrangling" folder
and follow the instructions in the README.md file.

Also included is a requirements.txt file, but it is essentially irrelevant, as all code is designed to be run through Google Colab (which standardizes packages across all users)
